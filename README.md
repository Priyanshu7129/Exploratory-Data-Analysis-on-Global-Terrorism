# Exploratory Data Analysis on Global Terrorism

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and data for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on global terrorism. The data used in this analysis is sourced from [Global Terrorism Database (GTD)](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/), which provides comprehensive information on terrorist attacks worldwide.

## Objective

The primary objective of this EDA is to gain insights into the patterns and trends of global terrorism over the years. By analyzing the data, we aim to uncover various aspects of terrorist activities, including:

1. Geographical distribution of attacks.
2. Temporal trends and patterns.
3. Most affected regions and countries.
4. Types of attacks and their frequencies.
5. Targets of terrorist attacks.
6. Perpetrator groups and their characteristics.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis can be found in the `archive(6).zip` directory. The data includes information about terrorist incidents, including the date, location, attack type, target type, terrorist group, number of casualties, and other relevant attributes.

## Methodology

The EDA is performed using Python programming language and various data analysis libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The code for the analysis can be found in the `EDA_terrorism.ipynb` directory, where Jupyter notebooks are used to conduct the exploratory analysis step-by-step.

## How to Use

To replicate the analysis on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries. 
3. Open the notebook titled `EDA_terrorism.ipynb`.
4. Execute each cell in the notebook to perform the analysis step-by-step.

## Results

The findings of the analysis will be presented in the `results` directory. This directory will include visualizations in the form of graphs, charts, and heatmaps to represent various aspects of global terrorism patterns.

## Conclusion

Exploratory Data Analysis on global terrorism can provide valuable insights into the nature and trends of terrorist activities worldwide. By understanding the patterns, we can work towards formulating more effective strategies to combat terrorism and promote global security.

## Disclaimer

It is important to note that the analysis presented here is based on historical data up to September 2021. As the global situation is subject to change, these findings may not represent the current state of global terrorism. For the most up-to-date information, it is recommended to refer to official sources and ongoing research on this subject.
